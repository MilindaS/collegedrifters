		The Mission for College Drifters is to provide college students with a direct platform to buy and sell items to each other. 
		By utilizing this marketplace students can inform others of events, notes, books, and tickets. 
		Technology allows for the world to communicate and get information ten times faster than a newspaper or bulletin board. 
		The goal of having students use College Drifters is to allow students to sell items to the same market without the information overload of other marketplaces 
		on the World Wide Web and noise of social media. We hope you enjoy using this marketplace to connect with college students near you. In order to improve, 
		we would love to hear your comments and concerns <a>collegedrifters@gmail.com</a>

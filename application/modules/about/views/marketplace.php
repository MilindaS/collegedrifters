					College Drifters was created by Mercedes Allen, because of an Internet Marketing class project requirement to have groups
					create an online business, Fall of 2012. After the class, Mercedes got involved with the entrepreneurship center at Mississippi
					State University and was advised by her professor to enter her concept of an online marketplace for college students in the
					business e-commerce competition.

					placed 1st and went on to compete in the final business plan competition with other 1st place winners, and place 3rd in the student
